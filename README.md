# Flash Security for Embedded Systems
#  Gestatten: The Flash | Security von Embedded Systemen pimpen - Wieso? Weshalb? Wow!

## üé§ Talk at Gulasch Programmier Nacht (GPN23)

**Title:** Meet: The Flash | Pimping Security of Embedded Systems - Why? How? Wow!  
**Event:** GPN23 (Gulasch Programmier Nacht)    
**Language:** GERMAN

## üéØ Abstract

Flash memory is more than just passive data storage ‚Äì it can be an active security component. This talk demonstrates how makers and professionals can leverage flash technologies like SD cards and eMMC to achieve security goals from encryption to secure boot, even on systems not originally designed for high security.

Topics covered:
- Flash Fundamentals
- Flash security fundamentals (RPMB, CID registers, write protection)
- Practical demos with Arduino/ESP32 and Raspberry Pi
- Security Level 2 microSD cards for retrofit security

## üöÄ Coming Soon

**References and further background infos to the security Features, defined in SD and EMMC Standards.**

**Code repositories and demos** from the presentation will be published here shortly, including:
- Arduino/ESP32 secure data logging examples
- Raspberry Pi secure boot implementations
